# Assignment #6
## Part #1 BarnesAndNoble Project
The BarnesAndNoble Project is part #1 of Assignment 6,
where I implemented and tested the 'BarnesAndNoble.java' file.
The goal is to ensure code quality through automated testing, which continues
in part #2.

## **Objectives For Part 1**
1. Set up the Assignment #6 project in IntelliJ
2. Write Specification-Based Tests for the BarnesAndNoble project
3. Write Structural-Based Tests to ensure complete code coverage.

## Specification-Based Tests and Structural-Based Tests
Tests are labels with @DisplayName("specification-based") or @DisplayName("structural-based") to indicate their category.

# How To Run The Project For Part 1
1. Open the terminal in IntelliJ
2. Use mvn clean, then mvn compile, and finally mvn test
3. After running mvn test, it will output a folder under jacoco called index.html
4. Once you open the index.html file, you will see the coverage results.

## Part #2
![Build Status](https://github.com/vader96/Assignment6v2/actions/workflows/SE333_CI.yml/badge.svg)  
This is the Build Badge to show the status of the project.  
This is a link to the workflow run:   
This part of the assignment automates testing and static analysis using GitHub Actions. 
## Part #3
For Part #3, I implemented test cases for the Amazon project, where I did specification, structural, integration, and unit testing.
## Specification-Based Tests and Structural-Based Tests
Tests are labels with @DisplayName("specification-based") or @DisplayName("structural-based") to indicate their category.
